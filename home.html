    <h2>I am currently taking a course in coding that is headed by a company called _nology. The course is great and designing a website as a portfolio is one of the tasks. So here we are. I joined the Navy out of High School and did that for 7 years. I was an EOD Tech(Explosive Ordnance Disposal), so I got to disarm IEDs and do a lot of other 'High Speed' things for a while. It was a lot of fun, but all great things must come to an end. Now I am starting a new chapter in my life. The chapter of TECH! I started with building computers. I built the computer I am currently using to make this, but I figured it wasn't enough. I wanted to know how the computer works in every aspect. <p id= "mainHover"> Enter Coding!</p> </h2>
